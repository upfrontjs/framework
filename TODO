// todo - figure out dependencies (lodash, pluralize, uuid) - likely to delivery with the package?
// todo - make sure to test file uploads
// todo - improve typings (eg.: collection pluck K extends keyof T, better user guards)
// todo - choose the right license
// todo - review all instances of eslint-disable-next-line
// todo - add built-in graphql support (single endpoint, query/body encoding/parsing)

// todo - will also need a cookbook to show the cool shit one might not think of straight away eg.: also in vue-press
    - local scope building
    - straight up send a form with the CallsApi methods
    - nested filters (given their api implements some parsing of Model.where('relation.column', 'value')

// todo - create CONTRIBUTING (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) file and include the following https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines
