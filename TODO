// todo - make sure to test file uploads
// todo - improve typings (eg.: collection pluck K extends keyof T, better user guards)
// todo - add built-in graphql support (single endpoint, query/body encoding/parsing)
// todo - tinker with node support (take callsApi out)

// todo - will also need a cookbook to show the cool shit one might not think of straight away eg.: also in vue-press
    - local scope building
    - straight up send a form with the CallsApi methods
    - nested filters (given their api implements some parsing of Model.where('relation.column', 'value')
